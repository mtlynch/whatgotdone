## Architecture

### Overview

![What Got Done Architecture](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vTolxqMjEtz6ujaM1a3ThkG3Tb1sJbv2O66TGRKVhaqNBoXtFdZjQaf3gS7l-pXbFlg02lPfM9c4foI/pub?w=917&amp;h=696)

What Got Done has a simple architecture consisting of the following parts:

* **What Got Done Backend**: A Go HTTP service (running on AppEngine) that handles all HTTP requests, datastore requests, and user authentication (via UserKit).
* **What Got Done Frontend**: A Vue2 app that renders pages in the user's browser.
* [**Cloud Firestore**](https://cloud.google.com/firestore/): What Got Done's storage provider.
* [**UserKit**](https://userkit.io): A third-party service that manages What Got Done's user authentication.

### Page Rendering Flow

What Got Done uses a somewhat unusual system for rendering pages. The Go backend first pre-renders the page server-side to populate tags related to SEO or social media that need to be set server-side. The Vue2 frontend renders the remainder of the page client-side. To avoid conflicts between the two systems' template syntax, Go uses `[[`, `]]` delimiters, while Vue uses `{{`, `}}` delimiters.

![What Got Done Render Flow](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vRqxoblMAAhrmI2xY_BEFmN3TRry7QdKvBOAK-1muJ79EJlJWwk1jS5t13vpjB7Kwbaf711ROMxG_cY/pub?w=1127&amp;h=1262)

The Go backend handles all of What Got Done's `/api/*` routes. These routes are What Got Done's RESTful interface between the frontend and the backend. These routes never send HTML, and instead only send JSON back and forth.

### User authentication

What Got Done uses [UserKit](https://docs.userkit.io/) for user authentication. For user signup, user login, and password reset, What Got Done loads the UserKit UI widgets in JavaScript. On the backend, the `auth` package is responsible for translating UserKit auth tokens into What Got Done usernames.

### Datastore

What Got Done uses [Google Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) for data storage.

Only the What Got Done backend can access the Firestore database. Specifically, the `datastore` package manages all interactions with Firestore.

### Integration tests

What Got Done's integration tests use Cypress and follow the testing pattern defined in the article [End-to-End Testing Web Apps: The Painless Way](https://mtlynch.io/painless-web-app-testing/). The testing architecture consists of four Docker containers (see [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/mtlynch/whatgotdone/blob/master/integration/docker-compose.yml)):

* Cloud Firestore emulator
* What Got Done container
* Cypress container
* Test data manager

The integration test is entirely self-contained, so nothing that happens during testing affects anything outside of the docker-compose environment.

To run the integration tests yourself, see the [section below](#optional-run-integration-tests).

## Contributing to What Got Done

Interested in contributing code or bug reports to What Got Done? That's great! Check our [Contibutor Guidelines](https://github.com/mtlynch/whatgotdone/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.

## QuickStart

To run What Got Done in a Docker container, run

```bash
docker-compose up
```

What Got Done will be running at [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).

Dev-mode authentication uses [UserKit dummy mode](https://docs.userkit.io/docs/dummy-mode). You can log in with any username using the password `password`.

## Development notes

### 0. Pre-requisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (8.x or higher)
* [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) (1.11 or higher)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (for E2E tests)

### 1. Start a Firestore emulator

Run the following command to start a [Google Cloud Firestore Emulator](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/beta/emulators/firestore/) in a Docker container:

```bash
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="dummy-local-gcp-project"
docker run \
  --detach \
  --env "FIRESTORE_PROJECT_ID=${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}" \
  --env "PORT=8080" \
  --publish 8080:8080 \
  --name firestore-emulator \
  mtlynch/firestore-emulator
```

### 2. Populate the database

To populate the database with initial data, run the test data manager:

```bash
pushd test-data-manager &&
  go build --tags "dev" -o /tmp/mgr . && \
  /tmp/mgr
popd
```

### 3. Build the frontend

To build the Vue frontend for What Got Done, run the following command:

```bash
pushd frontend && \
  npm install && \
  npm run build -- --mode development && \
  popd
```

### 4. Run the backend

To run the Go backend server, run the following command:

```bash
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="dummy-local-gcp-project"
export USERKIT_SECRET="dummy.dummy"
export FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST="localhost:8080"
env GO111MODULE=on go get github.com/cortesi/modd/cmd/modd
$GOPATH/bin/modd
```

What Got Done is now running on [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001). [Modd](https://github.com/cortesi/modd) is a hot reloading tool that will automatically rebuild and restart the server upon changes to any `.go` files.

Dev-mode authentication uses [UserKit dummy mode](https://docs.userkit.io/docs/dummy-mode). You can log in with any username using the password `password`.

### Optional: Run frontend with hot reloading

If you're making changes to the Vue code, you'll probably want to run the standard Vue HTTP server with hot reloading. Keep the backend running, and in a separate shell session, run the following command:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run serve
```

A hot-reloading Vue server will run on port [http://localhost:8085](http://localhost:8085). It will communicate with the What Got Done backend at port 3001.

### Optional: Pre-populate the datastore

What Got Done can run fine with an empty datastore, but if you want to populate it with some test data, run the following command to pre-populate the Firestore emulator:

```bash
./dev-scripts/reset-datastore
```

#### Quirks of the dev environment

Because the production What Got Done server runs both the frontend and the backend on a single port, there are a few hacks to make a development version work:

* CORS is enabled in dev mode so that the frontend can make CORS requests to the backend from a different HTTP port.
* CSRF protection is disabled in dev mode because the Vue dev server doesn't know how to render the `<meta name="csrf-token" />` tag.
* Page titles don't work properly in dev mode because the Vue dev server doesn't know how to render the `<title>` tag.
* The Content Security Policy header in dev mode needs `unsafe-eval` and `unsafe-inline`, whereas we disable this in production.

### Optional: Run backend unit tests

Unit tests run in normal Golang fashion:

```bash
go test ./...
```

### Optional: Run integration tests

Integration tests run all components together using a local Firestore emulator as the datastore and [UserKit dummy mode](https://docs.userkit.io/docs/dummy-mode) as authentication:

```bash
dev-scripts/run-integration-tests
```

### Optional: Enable public analytics from Google Analytics

What Got Done supports pulling metrics from Google Analytics into the page content. To enable this:

1. Enable the [Google Analytics Reporting API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/analyticsreporting.googleapis.com) in your Google Cloud Platform project.
1. Create a [service account](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts) in Google Cloud Platform console for your What Got Done project.
   1. Assign the service account no permissions/roles, but save its private key as JSON.
   1. Click "Create Key" to create a private key and save it in JSON format as `google-analytics-service-account.json` in the What Got Done root directory.
1. In Google Analytics, open Admin > View > View User Management and add the email address of the service account you just created (it will have an email like `[name]@[project ID].iam.gserviceaccount.com`.
   1. Grant the user only "Read & Analyze" permissions.
1. In Google Analytics, open Admin > View > View Settings
   1. Save the View ID as an environment variable like `export GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_VIEW_ID=12345789`

### Optional: Enable image uploads

What Got Done optionally allows image uploads from users. To enable this:

1. Create a Google Cloud Storage bucket
1. Choose uniform permissions for the bucket
1. Add to the bucket permissions for the `allUsers` user with the role "Storage Object Viewer"
  * This makes all images in the bucket world-readable.
1. When launching What Got Done, set the environment variable `PUBLIC_GCS_BUCKET` to the name of your GCS bucket.

When users paste images into their What Got Done entries, they will upload to your GCS bucket and auto-link from the entry editor.
