* Fixed handling of unexpected ingredients
* Added e2e test for 404 page
* Added e2e test for manual redirects
* Tried to join AdSense
  * Side effect: created a [Privacy Policy](https://isitketo.org/meta/privacy-policy)
* Added snippet for Amazon OneLink
* Got rid of Twitter specific meta tags when they had a fallback to opengraph properties.
* Tried to figure out why babel kept throwing errors on Circle CI but nowhere else.
* Found more links that were missing between pages.
